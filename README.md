You're very close! Let's walk through what's happening and how to fix it.

---

## ‚úÖ Step 1: Verify Docker and Docker Compose Installation

### üîç Check Docker

Run this in your terminal:

```bash
docker --version
```

You should see something like:

```
Docker version 24.0.6, build ed223bc
```

### üîç Check Docker Compose

There are two ways Docker Compose might be installed:

| Type                   | Command to Check           |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Standalone binary      | `docker-compose --version` |
| Integrated with Docker | `docker compose version`   |

Try both:

```bash
docker-compose --version
docker compose version
```

‚úÖ If either works, you're good.

---

## ‚ùó Problem: `unknown shorthand flag: 'd' in -d`

You're seeing this error:

```
unknown shorthand flag: 'd' in -d
```

This means you likely ran:

```bash
docker -d compose up
```

Or possibly your Docker version is old or aliasing incorrectly.

---

## ‚úÖ Correct Command

If you're using the **newer Docker Compose v2** (which is integrated into Docker):

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

If you're using the **older standalone `docker-compose`**, run:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

> üîÅ The command `docker compose up -d` **only works** if your Docker CLI includes Compose v2.

---

## üß™ Bonus: Check Compose Version and Compatibility

If you're unsure which you're using:

```bash
docker compose version
```

Example output:

```
Docker Compose version v2.20.2
```

If this fails, fall back to:

```bash
docker-compose version
```

If that works, use:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

---

## ‚úÖ Summary

| What You Want to Do            | Use This Command       |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| Docker Compose v2 (integrated) | `docker compose up -d` |
| Docker Compose v1 (standalone) | `docker-compose up -d` |

---

If you're still getting errors, paste the **first few lines** of your `compose.yaml`, and I‚Äôll verify it‚Äôs valid YAML and structured correctly.

---

Thanks for sharing your YAML and error message ‚Äî you're almost there! The error you're seeing:

```
ERROR: The Compose file './docker-compose.yaml' is invalid because:
Unsupported config option for volumes: 'data'
Unsupported config option for networks: 'frontend'
Unsupported config option for services: 'openwebui'
```

Usually indicates **one of two issues**:

---

## üîç 1. The file isn't being recognized as a valid Docker Compose YAML (v3+)

Your Compose file looks like it's meant for Docker Compose v3, but the presence of `---` at the top **may confuse** the parser in standalone Docker Compose v1.

### ‚úÖ Fix: Remove `---` from the top of your file

```yaml
# REMOVE THIS LINE
--- 
services:
  openwebui:
    image: ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:v0.6.10
    ...
```

Docker Compose doesn‚Äôt expect `---` unless you're explicitly managing multiple YAML documents ‚Äî which you're not here.

---

## üîç 2. File is named incorrectly or not passed explicitly

Make sure the filename is:

* `docker-compose.yaml` or `docker-compose.yml`
* You're in the correct directory when running the command

Or specify it directly:

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yaml up -d
```

---

## ‚úÖ Bonus: Validate Compose Version Compatibility

Run this:

```bash
docker-compose version
```

If you're using **v1.x**, and still getting unsupported key errors, it's possible your version is **very old** and doesn't fully support newer Compose features like `networks:` or `volumes:`.

### ‚úÖ Solution: Update Docker Compose

Install a newer standalone Docker Compose:

```bash
sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/latest/download/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" \
-o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

docker-compose --version
```

You should see something like:

```
Docker Compose version v2.20.2
```

---

## ‚úÖ Summary Fix Steps

1. **Remove `---`** from top of `docker-compose.yaml`
2. Ensure you're in the correct directory
3. Use `docker-compose -f docker-compose.yaml up -d` if unsure
4. **Update Docker Compose** if you're running a very old version

---

Let me know if you want help setting up the **`frontend` network** in Docker, or modifying this to work **without Traefik or Authentik**, for simpler testing.

---
Thanks ‚Äî this is the key:

> `docker-compose version 1.26.2, build eefe0d31`

You're running **Docker Compose v1.26.2**, which is **too old** to support the `volumes:` and `networks:` syntax used in modern Compose files (especially custom drivers and external networks).

---

## üö´ Why You‚Äôre Getting Errors

Docker Compose **v1.26.2** was released mid-2020, and many features in your `docker-compose.yaml` ‚Äî such as:

* Named volumes (`volumes: data:` with driver)
* External networks (`networks: frontend: external: true`)
* Possibly even complex `labels:` or `environment:` list-style syntax

‚Ä¶are **either broken or partially supported** in v1.26.

---

## ‚úÖ Solution: Upgrade Docker Compose

You should upgrade to **Docker Compose v2.x** (which also works with `docker compose`, not just `docker-compose`).

### üß± Option 1: Upgrade via Static Binary (Works Everywhere)

Run this on **Linux/macOS**:

```bash
sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/latest/download/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" \
-o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

docker-compose version
```

You should now see something like:

```
Docker Compose version v2.20.2
```

> On macOS with Homebrew, you can also use:
>
> ```bash
> brew install docker-compose
> ```

---

### ‚úÖ Option 2: Use `docker compose` Instead (If Docker CLI is Modern)

You may already have **Docker Compose v2 embedded** in Docker if you run:

```bash
docker compose version
```

If this shows a version like `v2.20.0`, you can just switch to using:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

(Notice: no hyphen!)

---

## üöÄ After Upgrading

Once you‚Äôre on v2.x or higher, re-run your original command:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

Or:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

It should now correctly parse your full `docker-compose.yaml`.

---

Would you like help **removing Traefik + Authentik** to make this work with just Ollama and OpenWebUI locally on `http://localhost:8080`?

---

Perfect ‚Äî let's simplify your `docker-compose.yaml` to remove:

* **Traefik reverse proxy**
* **Authentik (OAuth2 SSO)**
* External `frontend` network

Instead, we‚Äôll run **OpenWebUI** locally and connect it directly to **Ollama**, assuming both run on the same machine (default Ollama port is `11434`).

---

## ‚úÖ Clean `docker-compose.yaml` (Minimal, Local Setup)

```yaml
version: "3.8"

services:
  openwebui:
    image: ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:v0.6.10
    container_name: openwebui
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"  # Web UI available at http://localhost:8080
    environment:
      - OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://host.docker.internal:11434
    volumes:
      - openwebui_data:/app/backend/data
    restart: unless-stopped

volumes:
  openwebui_data:
```

---

## ‚úÖ Steps to Run

1. **Start Ollama (outside Docker)**

   On your host system (not in the Compose file), make sure Ollama is running:

   ```bash
   ollama serve
   ```

   Or it may already be running in the background after installing.

2. **Start OpenWebUI container**

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

3. **Visit Web UI**

   Go to: [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

   You should see the OpenWebUI interface connected to Ollama.

---

## üîß Notes

* `host.docker.internal` is used to allow the container to access Ollama on the host machine (works on Windows, macOS, and modern Docker on Linux).
* If you're on **Linux** and `host.docker.internal` doesn‚Äôt work, use `172.17.0.1` or your host's IP address instead.

---

## üß™ Want to add the `gemma` model?

You can do:

```bash
ollama run gemma:2b
```

Or preload it:

```bash
ollama pull gemma:2b
```

This ensures it's ready for OpenWebUI to use.

---

Let me know if you also want to:

* Run **Ollama in Docker**
* Add support for other models (Mistral, LLaMA3, etc.)
* Expose OpenWebUI to the internet securely (with HTTPS)



---

You're definitely close now ‚Äî great progress! Let's handle both the **warning** and the **fatal error** you're seeing.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è 1. Warning: `version` is obsolete

```bash
WARN[0000] ... the attribute `version` is obsolete
```

This is **just a warning** in Docker Compose v2+. Starting with Docker Compose v2.20, the `version:` field is no longer needed. You can safely **remove** this line:

```yaml
# version: "3.8"  ‚Üê delete this
```

But this is **not causing your error** ‚Äî just cleanup advice.

---

## ‚ùå 2. Fatal Error: Docker Daemon Not Running

```bash
Cannot connect to the Docker daemon at unix:///var/run/docker.sock. Is the docker daemon running?
```

This means Docker **itself is not running**, even though `docker-compose` is installed.

---

### ‚úÖ Solution: Start Docker

Depending on your OS, try the following:

### On Ubuntu / Debian:

```bash
sudo systemctl start docker
```

Check status:

```bash
sudo systemctl status docker
```

### On other systems:

* On **macOS or Windows**, make sure **Docker Desktop** is open and running.
* On **WSL2**, make sure Docker is integrated (start Docker Desktop).
* On **Linux without systemd**, try:

  ```bash
  sudo dockerd &
  ```

Then try again:

```bash
sudo docker-compose up -d
```

---

## üß™ Bonus Check

Test that Docker itself is running:

```bash
docker info
```

You should **not** see any errors like "Cannot connect to the Docker daemon".

---

## ‚úÖ Summary

| Problem                   | Solution                                                  |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `version` warning         | Remove `version:` line (optional)                         |
| Docker daemon not running | Run `sudo systemctl start docker` or start Docker Desktop |

---

Let me know your platform (Linux distro, WSL, macOS, etc.) if you're unsure how to start Docker ‚Äî I‚Äôll give exact steps.


---

You're on the right track ‚Äî the key issue is:

> üî• `docker.service` is **masked**, and `dockerd` command is **not found**

This strongly suggests that:

* Docker is **not properly installed** or
* It was **disabled/masked** intentionally (common on minimal/cloud images like EC2, LXC, or Docker-hosted VMs)

Let‚Äôs fix it.

---

## ‚úÖ Step-by-Step Fix

### üßπ Step 1: Unmask Docker

First, unmask the Docker service:

```bash
sudo systemctl unmask docker.service
sudo systemctl unmask docker.socket
```

Now try to start it again:

```bash
sudo systemctl start docker
```

Then check status:

```bash
sudo systemctl status docker
```

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è If That Still Fails‚Ä¶

You may not have Docker installed correctly at all.

---

## ‚úÖ Step 2: Install Docker Properly (Clean Reinstall)

Let‚Äôs use the official install script for Ubuntu/Debian-based systems:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
sudo sh get-docker.sh
```

This will:

* Install the latest Docker CE (Community Edition)
* Start the Docker daemon
* Set up systemd properly

Once done:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable docker
sudo systemctl start docker
```

Check it's working:

```bash
docker info
```

---

## üöÄ Then Run Your Compose File

Once Docker is running:

```bash
sudo docker-compose up -d
```

---

## üß† Bonus Tip (Optional): Run Docker Without `sudo`

To avoid always needing `sudo`, add your user to the `docker` group:

```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```

Then log out and back in, or run:

```bash
newgrp docker
```

| `dockerd: command not found`    | Docker is not installed ‚Üí Run `curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh && sudo sh get-docker.sh` |
| Can't use `docker` without sudo | Add user to `docker` group: `sudo usermod -aG docker $USER`                                                 |

---

Let me know your OS/distribution if you're unsure ‚Äî I‚Äôll tailor the install commands for it exactly.
